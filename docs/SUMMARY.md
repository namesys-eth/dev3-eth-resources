Dear ENS Developers, Enthusiasts & Community,

### ðŸš€ &nbsp;We are glad to announce the mainnet launch of our free subdomain project `dev3.eth`&nbsp; ðŸš€ 

#### ðŸ’¡ `dev3.eth` is a free subdomain project soulbound to the Github ecosystem. Any Github user [`arachnid`](https://github.com/arachnid) can redeem their soulbound subdomain `arachnid.dev3.eth` and host their subdomain's records on their Github Pages deployment with simple issues of commands such as `npm run init` and `npm run sign` in their consoles! Read more about `dev3.eth` below ðŸ‘‡

# About

`dev3.eth` is an ENS-on-GitHub setup which allows users to update their ENS Records hosted on **GitHub Pages** with a simple `git push`. Users of `dev3.eth` CLI can redeem a **free subdomain soulbound to their GitHub ID** **`<id>.dev3.eth`**. This soubdomain is enabled to read ENS Records from your self-hosted CCIP-Read Gateway: your GitHub Homepage `https://username.github.io`. Your records are signed by you and validated against [Man In The Middle attacks (MITM)](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-mitm/) due to hypothetical compromise of GitHub's centralised infrastructure by our [Cloudflare micro-approver](https://github.com/namesys-eth/dev3-eth-approver).

# Prerequisites

- `dev3.eth` feeds on your **GitHub Pages** for ENS Records. You must have your **GitHub Homepage** `https://<id>.github.io` configured to publish from `<id>.github.io` repository by default. Simple guide to doing this is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

  > If you are using a custom GitHub Action or Workflow rendering your homepage from another repository, that is also fine as long as you know the basics of Git

- It is advisable to have your GitHub Homepage auto-deploy upon push. This is default for `<id>.github.io` repository and **you don't need to do anything** in this case

  > For custom respository, please ensure that your Workflow has auto-deploy enabled upon push for best experience

- Have access to your `<id>.github.io` or custom repository linked to GitHub Pages. Duh!

# Claiming your `dev3.eth` Subdomain!

Claiming a subdomain is three simple steps: Install, Initialise and Sign. The **`install`** step installs the `dev3-eth` client. **`init`** step sets up the environment for publishing ENS records. **`sign`** step signs your records against any kind of tampering (e.g. by Github). 

ðŸ‘‡ Details are below in short form and then in long form after that! 

### STEP 1

`cd` into your `<id>.github.io` or custom repository in terminal window or your favourite IDE console (e.g. VS Code) with:

```bash
cd <id>.github.io
```

### STEP 2

Install `dev3-eth` CLI **locally** in your `<id>.github.io` or custom repository, or **globally** for better accessibility. That's it! You are now ready to redeem your free `dev3.eth` subdomain!

| Context  | Install | Initialise | Publish | Status  |
|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| `GLOBAL` | `npm i -g dev3-eth`  | `npx dev3-eth init` | `npx dev3-eth sign` | `npx dev3-eth status` |
| `LOCAL`  | `[1]`                | `npm run init`      | `npm run sign`      | `npm run status`      |

> ðŸ’¡ **HINT:** If you encounter `Permission Denied` error for `npx dev3` executable, allow it to run with: `chmod +x <path>/.bin/dev3`

### `[1]`

```bash
VERSION=0.0.3-beta && curl -LO https://namesys-eth.github.io/install.sh && source install.sh
```

# Extras

Each subdomain [`arachnid.dev3.eth.limo`](https://arachnid.dev3.eth.limo) has their profile auto-deployed by default in their contenthash ðŸ‘‡

### OR

## `LOCAL` Installation

Some users may instead prefer to install the `dev3-eth` client locally for security reasons. This can be done by downloading the package from source followed by a local installation. Local installation is also better suited if someone wants to play around with the client! ðŸ‘‡

### Install Package

```bash
VERSION=0.0.3-beta && curl -LO https://namesys-eth.github.io/install.sh && source install.sh
```

### Initialise `sub.dev3.eth` 

```bash
npm run init
```

### Sign Records for `sub.dev3.eth`

```bash
npm run sign
```

### View Records for `sub.dev3.eth`

```bash
npm run view
```
